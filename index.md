## interests and introduction
Hi my name is Daniel Kan. Im currenly UCSD 3rd year undergrad student, insterests are Tennis, surfing, snowboarding, coding, and MONEY. Here is a link to [my personal portfolio](https://about-daniel.vercel.app/).

I also play games such as ~~valorant~~, *counterstrike*, *civilization IV*.

My fav quote is from an ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zi:
>盈科而后进

which means *if you need to cross obstacles to pace forward in life*. 
This applies to my coding, namely hardworkingness in programming and always learning.
